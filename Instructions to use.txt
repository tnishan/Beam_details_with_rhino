Hello there! 
Steps for the workflow: 
1. Open ETABS2019 (or higher), complete the design work, get the reinforcement values and select the beams for which you want to generate cross sections. 
2. Open excel file named 'Beam data', go to grid and click generate grid button. There you'll see the unique names of beams that you've selected, 
it helps to check whether the unique names are as per the etabs or not. 
3. Open rhino file 'Rhino Source file' and then grasshopper from it 'Grasshopper main'. ( The rhino file consists some layers that are used in the beam details)
4. The beam details are generated as per the sheet serial no. in the excel file. 

Thank you.
